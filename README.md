# Flight-management-system
* The Flight Booking System is a project developed using C++ that includes graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and file handling.
* It allows admins to manage airports and routes, and lets users book or cancel airplane tickets and find the shortest path between airports.
* it also corrects user if they mispelled airport name by suggesting similar airport names. This uses dynamic programming in finding minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into the other.
